To save the trained SVM model after making predictions, you can use the joblib module from the sklearn.externals package. Here's an updated example of how to train an SVM model on a time series dataset, make predictions, and save the model (Time series data can be replaced with any real-world dataset, for example if cache is implemented for in-car entertainment system, then movie dataset would be useful to try! for predictions):


```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.svm import SVR
from sklearn.externals import joblib

# Define the time series data
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = np.roll(X, shift=-1)

# Define and train the SVM model
model = SVR(kernel='rbf', C=1e3, gamma=0.1)
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions using the trained model
X_test = np.random.rand(1, 1)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'svm_model.pkl')

# Print the predicted value
print('Predicted value:', y_pred[0])
```

The joblib.dump function is used to save the trained SVM model to a file named svm_model.pkl. This file can then be loaded later using the joblib.load function. Note that joblib is only available in scikit-learn version 0.23 and later, so make sure you have an up-to-date version installed.




An example of how to load the saved SVM model svm_model.pkl and train a neural network to mimic its behavior in Python using TensorFlow:
```
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.externals import joblib

# Load the saved SVM model
model = joblib.load('svm_model.pkl')

# Define the time series data
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = np.roll(X, shift=-1)

# Define the neural network architecture
model_nn = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(1,), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')
])

# Compile the neural network model
model_nn.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the neural network to mimic the SVM model
model_nn.fit(X, model.predict(X), epochs=100)

# Make predictions using the neural network model
X_test = np.random.rand(1, 1)
y_pred = model_nn.predict(X_test)

# Print the predicted value
print('Predicted value:', y_pred[0][0])
```

The saved SVM model is loaded using the joblib.load function. The time series data is defined in the same way as in the SVM example. The neural network architecture is defined using the tf.keras.Sequential class, and the compile method is used to specify the optimizer and loss function. The fit method is then used to train the neural network on the time series data, where the targets are the SVM model's predictions on the input data. Finally, the trained neural network is used to make a prediction on a new data point, and the predicted value is printed.

Note that this is just an example code, and the performance of the neural network heavily depends on the quality and complexity of the dataset, as well as the architecture and hyperparameters of the network. It is also worth noting that training a neural network to mimic an SVM model is cheap for local computaations where local budget is very small compared to global budget. Further RSU aand Edge Devices can be introduced to dump cache and fetched.

```
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_federated as tff
from sklearn.externals import joblib

# Load the saved SVM model
model = joblib.load('svm_model.pkl')

# Define the time series data
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = np.roll(X, shift=-1)

# Define the neural network architecture
model_nn = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(1,), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')
])

# Compile the neural network model
model_nn.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Define a TFF client dataset
client_data = tff.simulation.datasets.TestClientData({
    'x': X,
    'y': model.predict(X).reshape(-1, 1)
})

# Define a TFF model from the Keras model
def model_fn():
    return tff.learning.from_keras_model(
        model_nn,
        input_spec=client_data.element_type_structure,
        loss=tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError())

# Define a TFF federated learning process
fed_avg_process = tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process(
    model_fn,
    client_optimizer_fn=lambda: tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01))

# Initialize the TFF server state
state = fed_avg_process.initialize()

# Train the model using federated averaging
for i in range(10):
    state, metrics = fed_avg_process.next(state, [client_data])
    print('Round {:2d}, metrics={}'.format(i+1, metrics))

# Make predictions using the trained neural network model
X_test = np.random.rand(1, 1)
y_pred = model_nn.predict(X_test)

# Print the predicted value
print('Predicted value:', y_pred[0][0])
```

The trained neural network that mimics the SVM model is used to define a TFF model using the tff.learning.from_keras_model function. A TFF client dataset is defined using the same time series data as before, where the targets are the SVM model's predictions on the input data. A TFF federated learning process is then defined using the tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process function, and the model and client optimizer are passed as arguments. The process is initialized using the initialize method, and the model is trained for 10 rounds using the next method. Finally, the trained neural network model is used to make a prediction on a new data point, and the predicted value is printed.
